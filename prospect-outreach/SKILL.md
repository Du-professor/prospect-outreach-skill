  Analyze a user's company and prospective accounts in depth, score account fit
  separately from outreach readiness, select a customer or partnership path,
  and draft evidence-based consultative outreach. Use for prospect research,
  lead qualification, customer matching, account prioritization, product and
  technical fit analysis, bilingual or localized sales emails, contact routing,
  partner development, batch prospect review, reply drafting, and meeting
  preparation. Also use for Chinese requests such as 潜在客户分析, 客户匹配,
  外联邮件, 拓客邮件, 销售邮件草稿, 客户开发, 合作伙伴开发, 客户排序,
  邮件回复, and 会议准备.

# Prospect Outreach

Turn public company information and user-provided context into an evidence-traceable account decision and restrained outreach. Understand the prospect first, separate strategic fit from contactability, and introduce the user's capabilities only when evidence supports the connection.

## Required References

- Load `references/research-sources.md` before researching, resolving company identities, judging evidence, or handling missing inputs.
- Load `references/matching-framework.md` before scoring Account Fit, scoring Outreach Readiness, applying caps, or assigning priority.
- Load `references/output-contracts.md` before selecting an output mode or formatting a single-account or batch result.
- Load `references/email-sequences.md` before drafting email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, WeChat, or phone outreach.
- Load `references/compliance-rules.md` before recommending contact data, drafting outreach, or stating compliance and stop-contact rules.
- Load `references/account-development-playbooks.md` only when producing a buying-committee map, recommending a contact channel, handling replies, preparing a meeting, or using `deep` mode.

## Core Workflow

1. **Identify the request.** Extract the user-company website or description, prospect identity, contact details, target market, requested language, product-line constraints, sender context, prior-contact status, outreach scenario, and output mode. Use `standard` when no mode is requested.
2. **Apply missing-input rules.** If the user company is missing, return only a missing-information checklist. If the prospect is missing, return only a generic ICP hypothesis and checklist. Do not score or draft sales outreach in either case. If the contact role is missing, continue without lowering Account Fit; lower and cap Outreach Readiness and use routing-oriented copy.
3. **Normalize accounts and contact status.** Resolve company name variants, distinguish parent companies from subsidiaries, merge duplicates, and preserve `not contacted`, `contacted`, `paused`, `do not contact`, or `long-term nurture` status. Never create a new initial sequence for an account already inside an active cadence.
4. **Research current facts.** Use current public sources when URLs, company names, or public claims are provided. Prefer official pages and recent primary material. Record URL, page title, source type, publication or access date, freshness, and affected score dimension. Label user-provided claims that cannot be confirmed as `User-provided, not independently verified`.
5. **Profile both companies.** Analyze only user-company capabilities relevant to the prospect. Profile the prospect's products, services, solutions, business model, industries, applications, technical architecture clues, buying organization, current initiatives, constraints, pain hypotheses, and triggers.
6. **Map the opportunity.** Build the product mapping matrix required by `output-contracts.md`. Select one primary path and any credible secondary path from end customer, OEM supply, systems-integration partnership, channel/distributor cooperation, technical partnership, or long-term nurture. State why other paths are weaker.
7. **Score separately.** Calculate Account Fit out of 100 and Outreach Readiness out of 100 using `matching-framework.md`. Derive base priority from Account Fit, apply the Readiness cap, then apply evidence, identity, status, and sensitive-industry caps. Show raw scores, caps, final priority, and downgrade reasons.
8. **Draft score-aware outreach.** Use the analysis language and sendable-language policy in `email-sequences.md`. P1 and P2 receive four-email sequences. P3 receives one routing/research email plus one explicitly optional follow-up. P4 receives no outreach by default; provide one neutral research note only when the user explicitly requests it.
9. **Handle downstream sales work conditionally.** When asked about an email address, recommend only a public business-relevant contact channel. When the user provides a reply, stop the planned sequence and draft a context-aware response. When a meeting is requested, generate the clarification reply, platform/time questions, 30-minute agenda, discovery questions, preparation list, and post-meeting follow-up.
10. **Run QA and return the selected output mode.** Revise drafts until required checks pass. State unresolved placeholders and missing evidence. Do not send messages, connect mailboxes or CRM systems, discover private addresses, or create bulk sending automation.

## Output Modes

- `brief`: Return a decision snapshot, both scores, final priority, best angle, key missing evidence, and the first permitted message.
- `standard` (default): Return the full profile, evidence summary, opportunity path, mapping matrix, both scores, priority, permitted email package, CRM fields, QA, and compliance notes.
- `deep`: Add detailed technical analysis, complete evidence ledger, buying-committee map, objections, contact-channel recommendation, and reactivation conditions.
- `batch`: Normalize and deduplicate accounts, preserve contact status, return a priority table, and deeply analyze only P1/P2 unless the user asks for every account.

Follow the exact sections and fields in `references/output-contracts.md`. If the user asks for a Markdown artifact, write the selected output to an `.md` file in the current workspace and link it.

## Quality Rules

- Write the analysis in the user's current language unless requested otherwise.
- Separate official fact, third-party fact, weak signal, reasonable inference, and unknown.
- Tie every material fit claim to a prospect workflow and a demonstrated user-company capability.
- Treat pain points as hypotheses unless directly sourced.
- Keep one primary CTA per message and avoid broad product catalogs.
- Do not fabricate relationships, referrals, internal knowledge, certifications, compatibility, customer logos, ROI, savings, or procurement intent.
- Do not infer private email patterns or expose personal data.
- Prefer research, routing, or nurture when evidence or readiness is weak.
- Pause the planned sequence after any reply. Suppress further outreach after opt-out, explicit refusal, complaint, or permanent bounce.
